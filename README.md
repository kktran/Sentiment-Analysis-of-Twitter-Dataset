### Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Dataset

Problem: Perform binary classification of labeled Twitter tweets into positive and negative categories
Approach: 
  1) Use statistical machine learning methods typical in natural language processing such as Naive Bayes, TF-IDF within scikit-learn to        create a predictive model
  2) Use neural network based models (feed-forward, recurrent, convolutional) within Keras/Tensorflow to create a predictive model
Results:
  1) Achieved 78% accuracy using scikit-learn models (Naive Bayes)
  2) Achieved 82% accuracy using recurrent neural networks with embedding layer using GloVe word embeddings
